      [li][size=12pt][u]2.1 About WormNet[/u][/size]
        [list][li][spoiler]The server, Worms: Armageddon is using for online games, is called WormNet. When you join there you have to choose a channel where you would like to play at.

[img]https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0m2zptnfjh6vse/screen000.png?dl=1[/img]

#PartyTime and #RopersHeave are rarely used, you can find all the people in #AnythingGoes. Double click on it to join there. When you joined the channel you can find the players on the right side and the games on top left of the screen.

We know that playing online like this is not so convenient. There is no buddy list, hard to chat in private and the game must be opened all the time. The solution is using a little software, called Snooper. You can read about snoopers in the next section.[/spoiler][/li][/list]
      [/li]


      [li][size=12pt][u]2.2 Snoopers[/u][/size]
        [list][li][spoiler]Snoopers are little, easy-to-use applications written by wormers to make WormNet more convenient. First of all you don't need to open the game to be online. You can chat, host and join games, have buddy list, set notifications and many other things that makes your life easier. In short, a snooper is a must-have, a lot of people are using them. Furthermore these applications are open source, so you can fully trust in them, they don't have any harmful things.

The most used snoopers are Great Snooper and The Wheat Snooper, but ProSnooper is also still in use. Use which you like the most. ;)

      [li][size=12pt][u]2.3 Game names[/u][/size]
        [list][li][spoiler]Game names are usually scheme, clan or player names. Schemes are game modes. If a host name is a scheme, then that game mode will be played there. If the game name is a clan name then a clan vs clan league game (clanner) will be there, if a game name is player name then an 1v1 league will be there. This is a habit, we use password for a game very rare.[/spoiler][/li][/list]

      [li][size=12pt][u]3.1 About Schemes[/u][/size]
	    [list][li][spoiler]Game modes are called schemes. They can be groupped by ground schemes, rope based schemes, race schemes and other schemes. There are a lot of them, here we would like to present you the most known ones.[/spoiler][/li][/list]
	  [/li]
	  
	  
      [li][size=12pt][u]3.2 Ground schemes[/u][/size]
        [list][li][spoiler]The most known ground schemes are Intermediate/Normal, Team 17, Elite, Hysteria and BnG. The goal of these schemes is to kill the opponent team(s).

[b]Intermediate[/b] (or normal) is the traditional default game mode. It is played with 8 worms per player in 1v1 mode, and 4 worms per player in case of 2v2. In the league scheme there are no crates falling. [url=http://worms2d.info/Intermediate]More info and replay[/url]

In [b]Team 17[/b] (T17) in the beginning of the game you will have very weak weapons only. But in every turn a weapon crate (cr8) falls, from which you can get stronger weapons. T17 is played with 4 worms per player in 1v1 mode and 2 worms per player in case of 2v2. You must use map type [url=http://worms2d.info/Map_Editor_Guide]dual-layer cave[/url]. Rope and bungee knocking are not allowed. [url=http://worms2d.info/Team17_(scheme)]More info and replay[/url]

[b]Elite[/b] is a scheme similar to Intermediate, but with only 20 seconds turn time, fewer weapons and instant mines. It is played 4 worms per player in 1v1 mode and 2 worms per player in case of 2v2. Rope and bungee knocking are not allowed. Only opened maps are allowed. [url=http://worms2d.info/Elite]More info and replay[/url]

[b]Hysteria[/b] is a special scheme where quick thinking and reflexes are vital. Each turn only lasts for a meagre one second, in which the player must select and fire a weapon. This may sound crazy for the first time, but there are still a lot of possibilities to do. It is played 4 worms per player in 1v1 mode and 2 worms per player in case of 2v2. [url=http://worms2d.info/Hysteria]More info and replay[/url]

[b]BnG[/b] (Bazooka and Grenades) is a traditional scheme. In the beginning of the game you must teleport your worm one of the sides of the map and your opponent(s) must go to the other side. Worms can't walk and you must kill your opponent using bazooka and grenades only. There are several rules like: no darksiding (= you must not teleport where your worm can not be hit), grenade can't be stopped on the ground for more than one second before exploding and hitting a worm and straight shots of bazooka are not allowed. It is played with one worm per player both in 1v1 and 2v2 modes. [url=http://worms2d.info/Bazooka_and_Grenades]More info and replay[/url][/spoiler][/li][/list]
      [/li]
	  
	  
	  [li][size=12pt][u]3.3 Rope based schemes[/u][/size]
        [list][li][spoiler]In these schemes you will need to use ninja rope a lot which is really fun. The most known rope based schemes are Shopper, WxW Shopper, and Roper. The goal of these schemes is to kill the opponent team(s). These schemes need special type of maps.

[b]Shopper[/b] is the easiest rope based scheme. There are 3 rules here: AFR = [i]attack[/i] only [i]from rope[/i] (except with ground weapons, ex. shotgun), CBA = take at least one [i]create before attack[/i], KTL = [i]kill the leader[/i] (in fun games only). This scheme is like a rope based Team 17, you can get strong weapons from crates. In fun games the rules "AFR CBA KTL" should be sent to the hoster or you may be kicked out from the game. In league Shopper is played with 4 worms per player in 1v1 mode and 2 worms per player in case of 2v2. [url=http://worms2d.info/Shopper]More info and replay[/url]

[b]WxW Shopper[/b] (WxW in short) is a hardened shopper where you also have the rule WBA = touch all the marked [i]walls before attack[/i]. This scheme is played usually on linear maps where you can rope very fast and a lot of roping tricks can be done, that's why ropers like it much. In fun games the rules "AFR CBA KTL WBA" should be sent to the hoster or you may be kicked out from the game. In league WxW Shopper is played with 3 worms per player in 1v1 mode and 2 worms per player in case of 2v2. [url=http://worms2d.info/Wall-X-Wall_Shopper]More info and replay[/url]

[b]Roper[/b] is the hardest rope based scheme. It is usually played on a special type of maps which look like 2 trees. The rules are the same as in shopper, but here health crates are falling. You have got bazooka, grenades and mines to attack. In the first turn only bazooka can be used. You must not block the worm of your opponent. After sudden death there are no more crates falling, you must touch the left and the right border of the map before attack. It is played with one worm per player both in 1v1 and 2v2 modes.
