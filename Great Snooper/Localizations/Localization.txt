AboutWormNat2Text=About WormNat 2: If you host with the game, then it will create the server on your computer and it will wait for players to join on a specified port (usually 17011). But most of the routers and firewall programs don't allow incoming connections, so nobody can join your game. You will need to enable port forwarding on your router and/or configure your firewall if you use one in order to let players join your game. WormNat2 uses a technique, that you can host games without incoming connections so your host will work properly. To make this possible it uses a dedicated proxy server, which actually handles all the connections. But since there is no support for other proxy servers, we would much rather that you configure your system to use normal way of hosting your games and use WormNat2 only if nothing else works so the proxy server will not be overloaded. Enable loading WormKit modules are NOT needed to use WormNat2 hosting feature of the snooper!
